## Ward Level Mid-Year Population Estimates

This dataset provides estimates of the usual resident population for 2016 electoral wards in Greater Manchester. The data derives from the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/wardlevelmidyearpopulationestimatesexperimental).

We have provided the data in CSV and keyed JSON formats. The key chosen in the JSON file is the ward code (wd16cd) allowing easy joining to spatial datasets/geometries.
